The next four chapters study the way computers try to mimic this human performance, including speech signal analysis techniques, speech coding models, text-to-speech conversion (synthesis) and speech-to-text conversion (recognition) techniques. The last of these four chapters covers not only the speech recognition area but also the speaker and language recognition areas. The final chapter frequently includes talks by researchers of other areas of natural language processing (namely from other faculties) and/or visits to labs.
